Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People
=======================================

Hey! Welcome to this repo containing my notes of this textbook for better understanding of Data Structures.

This repo contains my notes (open-sourced) along with a <a href="https://grokking-documentation.readthedocs.io/">super structured website</a> for anyone to read + understand!

I've also put this in medium form for readers [link TBD] + <a href="notes.pdf">pdf format</a>, along with my <a href="annotated_textbook.pdf">annotated copy</a> of it for anyone to read.

Have fun, and make sure to give it a star!
