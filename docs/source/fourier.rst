Fourier transform
=====

Fourier transform is essentially this algorithm that can basically, *given a smoothie, the Fourier transform will tell you the ingredients in that smoothie. Or given a song, the transform can separate it into individual frequencies.*

What's the use case? **With songs, you can boost the individual frequencies you care about (boost bass, hide the treble).** 

Can also be used in compressing music. Break down the audio file into its ingredient notes. From there, the transform will tell you exactly how much each note contributes to the song. Then you delete the irrelevant notes. That's exactly how mp3 works!
