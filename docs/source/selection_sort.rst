Selection sort
=====

.. _music:

Music!
------------

Let's say that I'm sorting music

.. figure:: images/8.png
   :align: center

I go from choosing the most played songs all the way down to the least. I start off with my original list and then append all of that (in ordered form) to this new list.

.. figure:: images/9.png
   :align: center

As we do this over and over again, every single time, this overall process ends up taking **O(n*n) or O(n*2) time**

Selection sort is quite neat, but not really that fast. Quicksort is a lot fast, it only takes **O(n log n) time!**


Code
----------------

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
        def findSmallest(arr):
	        smallest = arr[0]
	        smallest_index = 0
	        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
			if arr[i] < smallest:
			  smallest = arr[i]
			  smallest_index = i
		return smallest_index
        def selectionSort(arr):
	        newArr = []
	        for i in range(len(arr)):
			smallest = findSmallest(arr)
			newArr.append(arr.pop(smallest))
	        return newArr
>>> print selectionSort([5, 3, 6, 2, 10])
[2, 3, 5, 6, 10]
