Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People
===================================

I recently read Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People and it really inspired me to open-source my notes

Quick TLDR; on who I am: `I'm a 15yo (at the time of writing this) <http://srianumakonda.com>`_ self-driving car enigneer, `one of the youngest in the world. <https://twitter.com/srianumakonda/status/1393649008409813003>`_ Am super fascinated by self-driving and how we can create a generalized, end2end model, capable of having robust preformance fully through Computer Vision. Recently built DataGAN

Now: currently buidling a fully e2e mdoel through Computer Vision. Here's my repo for code + current progress. Here's a tweet showing self-driving in steering (take a look below!)
